# LibraryProject

Hello! This is a project of mine, idea given by Daboi.
I have completed the first version of the project, yey!

Daboi, if you're reading this, I am very sure I also misunderstood the assignment
or try harded a bit too much. xD - written by Kohu, 03.08.2024, around ~11 PM. 

Before you copy paste this, this project uses MSVC compiler,
C++20 language standard, and you have to make a file called "BOOKS" (in caps) in your project's directory.
Or just change the path string in ```string basepath{}``` accordingly.
