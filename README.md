# LibraryProject

Hello! This is a project of mine.
I am still adding features and debugging it, but am putting this here to see.
Daboi, if you're reading this, I am very sure I also misunderstood the assignment
or try harded a bit too much. xD

Before you copy paste this, this project uses MSVC compiler,
C++20 language standard, and you have to make a file called "BOOKS" (in caps) in your project's directory.
Or just change the path string in ```string basepath{}``` accordingly.
